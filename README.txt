Hello,
This is a test demo I made to practice Unity during my free time. I'm still working on the demo but currently busy with school.
I plan to create a small game from this demo later, with a short storyline et full animations.
Every assest, animation and script from this demo was made by myself. I used blender to create all 3D models and animations. Scripts were made following a tutorial on youtube by Single Sapling Games.

Thank you for downloading.
